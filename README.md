# Quiz Generator using WPF and MVVM Architecture

This repository contains a quiz generator application developed in C# using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern. The main objective of this project was to create a quiz generation tool with the ability to create new quizzes and edit existing ones. Each quiz can have multiple questions, and each question can have multiple correct answers. This project was part of a university assignment, where a two-person team collaborated, with one person working on the quiz generator and the other person developing the quiz-solving application. Additionally, the application integrates a database using Entity Framework and SQLite.

# Features
* MVVM Architecture: The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel pattern, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.
* Quiz Generation: Users can create new quizzes with multiple questions and multiple correct answers per question.
* Quiz Editing: Existing quizzes can be edited by adding, modifying, or removing questions and answers.
* Database Integration: The application supports database functionality through Entity Framework and SQLite, enabling persistent storage of quizzes.
* User-Friendly Interface: The WPF interface provides an intuitive and visually appealing experience for generating and managing quizzes.
